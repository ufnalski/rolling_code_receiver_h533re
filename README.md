# Rolling/hopping code authentication demo (receiver) [STM32H533RE]
The relevant transmitter node is [here](https://github.com/ufnalski/rolling_code_transmitter_h533re).

# Missing files?
Don't worry :slightly_smiling_face: Just log in to MyST and hit Alt-K to generate /Drivers/CMCIS/ and /Drivers/STM32H5xx_HAL_Driver/ based on the .ioc file. After a couple of seconds your project will be ready for building.
